# AMS - Application Management Services

## Overview

AMS is my first web application built on the Spring MVC framework using Maven 3.0.2 and Java JDK 17. The application was created as a learning project to gain experience with key Spring MVC concepts and technologies. The following concepts have been covered as part of this project:

- `@RequestMapping`, `@ResponseBody`, `GET`, `POST`, `@RequestParam`, `@PathVariable`
- `th:object`
- `@Entity`, `@Repository`, `@Autowired`
